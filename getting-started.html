<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Software Requirements</h2>You will need the following tools:
<ul>
	<p class="text-content">
	<li>  	<h3>Git</h3>
  	The labs are on GitHub, so you will need Git to get to them. You can download Git <b><a href="http://git-scm.com/download">here</a></b>.<br>
  	An excellent tutorial for git can be found <b><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">here</a></b>.  	  	<p>  	To clone the scala-labs repo, use the following command:<br>
  	<code>git clone git://github.com/scala-labs/scala-labs.git</code>  	</p>  </li>
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-content">
	<li>  	<h3>Maven 2.2.x</h3>
  	The Scala-labs projects are built using Maven 2. Get it <b><a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</a></b>.   	The build has been verified with Maven 2.2.1. Older versions might also work but have not ben tested	</li>
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-content">
	<li>  	<h3>A Java VM</h3>
  	Scala compiles to JVM bytecode, so you will need a JVM to run any of the labs.   	Download it <b><a href="http://java.com/download/index.jsp">here</a></b>.<br> or use the one that comes built into your OS.  	We have tested on Java 5 and Java 6 without problems. Older versions are unlikely to work.	</li>
	</p>
	
	<li>  	<h3>Scala</h3>
  	Since this <i>is</i> a Scala lab, you will need a basic Scala installation.   	To get one, go to the scala <b><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">download</a></b> page and follow the
  	directions for your platform.<br>	</li>
	</p>
	
	<p class="text-content">
	<li>  	<h3>IDE Support</h3>
  	There are scala plugins available for   	<b><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94">Eclipse</a></b>,   	<b><a href="http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=1347">IntelliJ</a></b> and 
  	<b><a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/Scala">Netbeans</a></b>,   	but be warned: the maturity of these plugins is not exactly on par with the Java support that you might be accustomed to.<br>  	  	<p>  	At our live Scala Labs sessions	we use <a href="http://bit.ly/8Sbq0k">IntelliJ Community Edition</a> (IdeaCE) and nightly builds  	of the Scala plugin since they are the most stable and feature complete at the moment.<br>   	</p>  	  	<p>  	The latest versions that we have tested and which work together well are: IdeaCE 90.193 (the latest beta as of November 25th 2009) and   	<a href="http://download.jetbrains.com/scala/scala-intellij-bin-0.3.190.zip">nightly build number 190 of the Scala plugin.  	To install the plugin, simply unzip it and copy the resulting "Scala" directory to the plugins directory of Idea.  	</p>  	  	<p>
  	Of course, you can always use your favorite text editor. Some of us even switched back to <b><a href="http://thegreylensmansview.blogspot.com/2009/03/stone-tools-and-scala-development-part.html">emacs</a></b>.	</li>
	</p>	
</ul>
<h2>The labs</h2><p class="text-content">  After getting the code with Git (see above), you will have two maven projects called   <a href="http://github.com/scala-labs/scala-labs/tree/master/labs/">"labs"</a> and   <a href="http://github.com/scala-labs/scala-labs/tree/master/solutions/">"solutions"</a>.  The "labs" project has a lot of failing unit tests and your job is to fix them, starting with the super-simple  <a href="http://github.com/scala-labs/scala-labs/blob/master/labs/src/test/scala/org/scalalabs/basic/lab01/Exercise01Test.scala">first test in the first basic lab</a>,   which features our old friend "hello world". The "solutions" project contains our solutions in case you get stuck.
</p><p class="text-content">  There is an IntelliJ Idea project included in the "labs" and "soluions" projects. You might have to define a JDK in the project settings before the project will compile.</p>
