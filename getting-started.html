<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p class="text-content">
  OK, so you want to get some hands-on Scala coding done. Here's what you need to get started with the labs: 
</p>

<h3>Git</h3>
The labs are on GitHub, so you will need Git to get to them. You can download Git <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">here</a>. Copy this command into you terminal to do a basic 
svn-style checkout:<br><br>
<code>git clone git://github.com/scala-labs/scala-labs.git</code><br><br>
If you have trouble with Git later on, an excellent tutorial can be found <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">here</a>. 
<br>
<h3>Maven 2.x</h3>
The Scala-labs projects are built using Maven 2. Get it <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</a>.
<br>
<h3>A Java VM</h3>
Scala compiles to JVM bytecode, so you will need a JVM to run any of the labs. Download it <a href="http://java.com/download/index.jsp">here</a>.
<br>
<h3>Scala</h3>
Since this <i>is</i> a Scala lab, you will need a basic Scala installation. To get one, go to the scala <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">download</a> page and follow the
directions for your platform. 
<br>
<h3>IDE Support</h3>

There are scala plugins available for <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=1347">IntelliJ</a> and 
<a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/Scala">Netbeans</a>, but be warned: the maturity of these plugins is not exactly on par with the Java support that you might be accustomed to.<br><br>
Of course, you can always use your favourite text editor. Some of us even switched back to <a href="http://thegreylensmansview.blogspot.com/2009/03/stone-tools-and-scala-development-part.html">emacs</a>.
