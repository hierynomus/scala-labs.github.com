<h1>The Labs</h1>
<p class="text-content">
We developed several scala labs for you, some relatively simple to practice with if you have no Scala knowledge whatsoever, others are a bit more advanced
for those of you who have already played around with Scala a bit.<br>
To get started with the labs just take a look at the unit tests that are in the labs/src/test folder and start doing the exercises by fixing the failing tests.
</p>

<h3>Basic Labs</h3>
<p class="text-content">
If you are taking your very first steps with the Scala language, these labs are for you. Even though these labs are designed for people with little or no Scala
experience you will learn about some pretty specific Scala stuff like <b><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/126">traits</a></b>, 
<b><a href="http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/ch06.html#CompanionObjects">companion objects</a></b> and 
<b><a href="http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/ch12.html#ACloserLookAtLists">list manipulation</a></b>.
</p>

<p class="text-content">
Scala is all about managing side effects, so even though it might be hard at first, try to avoid the the use of variables and opt for (immutable) values 
instead. All exercises can be implementing without using the <code>var</code> keyword once!
</p>

<h3>Intermediate Labs</h3>
<p class="text-content">
If you have some experience with Scala and are already getting familiar with its language constructs, take a swing at these labs. The theme of these labs is
Twitter and they will work with the real <b><a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a></b>.

<h3>Playground</h3>
