<h1>About Scala Labs</h1>

<p class="text-content">

<h2>History</h2>

<p class="text-content">
  The idea for this site came out of a small in-company workshop to share our knowledge and passion for Scala with some of our colleagues. 
  We created 4 <italic>intermediate</italic> labs and one <italic>advanced</italic> Lift web application for them to play with during this workshop.
  Since we didn't want our efforts go to waste Scala Labs was created.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p class="text-content">
  In the coming months we are going to be hosting more public hands-on sessions for which we 
  will be creating more labs. Our idea for the future is that people will start contributing labs to this site 
  and create a fun, one-stop community for learning Scala.
