<h1>Welcome to <span class="dark">Scala Labs</span></h1>

<p class="text-content">
  If you are looking for a great, hands-on way to learn Scala, then this is the place for you. This site
  will host a (hopefully soon) huge collection of hands-on labs that will teach you the ins and outs of 
  this great programming language.
</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p class="text-content">
  The idea for this site came out of a small in-company workshop to teach our colleagues something about Scala. 
  This means that are starting with 4 <italic>intermediate</italic> labs and one <italic>advanced</italic> Lift
  web application. In the coming months we are going to be hosting more public hands-on sessions for which we 
  will be creating more labs. Our idea for the future is that people will start contributing labs to this site 
  and create a fun, one-stop community for learning Scala.
