<h1>Welcome to <span class="dark">Scala Labs</span></h1>

<p class="text-content">
  If you are looking for a great, hands-on way to learn Scala, then this is the place for you. This site
  will host a (hopefully soon) huge collection of hands-on labs that will teach you the ins and outs of 
  this great programming language.
</p>
<p class="text-content">
  The goal of this site is to make it as easy as possible to get some hands-on experience with Scala. To that end we have developed a series of simple step-by-step exercises ranging from very basic indeed to a more advanded level.

    <span class="title">Scala Labs at the J-Fall Conference</span>
    On wednesday November 11th we are hosting a full day walk-in, hands-on labs experience at the NLJUG <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2009/">J-Fall conference</a> in Spant !, Bussum, the Netherlands. We will have ten laptops prepared but you can also bring your own machine and use one of our usb sticks to get started hacking Scala. This is our first public appearance so if you live in the Netherlands, come visit us and get your hands dirty with the Scala coding.

    <span class="title">We are Ready to Roll !</span>
    Our self-imposed deadline is here and we think we have created enough labs and exercises for people to start playing with them, so from today we are officially live ! If you want some hands-on experience with Scala coding, hurry over to our <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> page and check out our labs.
  </p>    <p>  We have worked hard the last couple of weeks to bring you the first batch of labs. These latest labs are mostly focused on the absolute basics so they are a good place to start. The original, slightly more advanced labs that we developed for a company-internal course have been left mostly unchanged except for some polishing here and there. They are a good starting point if you have already read one of the Scala books or if you want to refresh your basics a bit by playing around with the Twitter API using Scala.  </p>

    <a href="http://www.xebia.com/scalalabs"><span class="title">On Tour in the Netherlands</span></a>
    This December we are taking the Scala Labs on the road with some live hands-o sessions around the Netherlands to reach out to our fellow Dutch developers who are interested in Scala. We will be doing a short introduction presentation but most of the focus will be on getting our hands dirty with some Scala labs.
